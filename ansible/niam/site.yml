    # The virtuoso container may have problems.
    # The first time you build and launch it, it might crash, but work when restarted.
    # It might not stop gracefully and leaves a lock file that needs to be deleted.
    # When it is started with a new dump to load, it will take at least an hour to load the full dataset,
    # and if the machine doesn't have enough resources it might get stuck.
    # When restarting it, you may need to wait for the transactions to replay.
